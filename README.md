*coming soon...*

**[29-12-2023]** I am currently working on an AST parser based solution, with a custom obfuscator.io string reconstructor (no slow dependencies like synchrony or webcrack), which will extract the vidsrc.to keys at runtime (fast üí™).

I have a fair bit of work to do yet, but heres a sneak peek at the unoptimized first iteration on my slow laptop.

Will release soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, stay posted!

### TODO
- [ ] Finish AST parser string reconstructor
